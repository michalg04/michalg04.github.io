We present a Multimodal Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis framework (MADDi) to accurately detect the presence of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from imaging, genetic, and clinical data. MADDi is novel in that we use cross-modal attention, which captures interactions between modalities—a method not previously explored in this domain. We perform multi-class classification, a challenging task considering the strong similarities between MCI and AD. We compare with previous state-of-the-art models, evaluate the importance of attention, and examine the contribution of each modality to the model’s performance.
