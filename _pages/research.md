Explainabile and Scalable Multi-modal Learning
======
**Brown University, 2021 - Current**  
*Advisors: Ritambhara Singh and Carsten Eickhoff*

I am researching methods in attention-based deep learning to make multimodal algorithms more scalable and explainable.

Research at Cal Poly, Undergraduate
======

**Student Researcher at Amazon Web Services (hosted by DxHub Cal Poly), 2019-2020**  
*Advisor: Dr. Joyce Lin*  
I worked on image classification to automate the identification and geotagging of key road features such as pedestrian facilities, lanes, and traffic signals to substantially lower the diagnostic cost on a global scale.

**Student Researcher at Cal Poly Statistics Department, 2019-2020**  
*Advisor: Dr. Hunter Glanz*  
I developed and expanded R Shiny app for conducting exploratory bioacoustics analysis. In addition, I created a segmentation algorithm for sound files that distinguish between marine animal sounds and background noise.
