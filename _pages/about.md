I am a fourth year PhD Candidate at Brown University co-advised by Carsten Eickhoff in the [Health NLP Lab](https://health-nlp.com/index.html) and Ritambhara Singh in the [Singh Lab](https://rsinghlab.org/). My research interests include multimodal learning, mechanistic intepretability, and biomedical applications of deep learning. I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics, concentrating in Computer Science and Statistics, with a minor in Data Science from California Polytechnic State University, SLO. In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, cooking, and playing with my dog.
